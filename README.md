# Motor Vehicle Crashes in New York
## Summary

*This repository includes the data analysis of motor vehicle crashes in New York. 
*Applied machine learning classification decision trees and clustering and retreive the following interesting findings: 

*Finding 1: Bicycles see more accidents from poor environments while motorcycles see more accidents from unsafe driving.
In addition both bicycles and motorcycles are seeing reductions in poor environment accidents over time, while unsafe driving is on the rise.

* Finding 2: Even though Suburbans are commonly considered safer than sedans due to their increased size and relatively lower accident count, Suburbans are more prone to indulging in an accident when the driver is backing.
However, among crashed cars that were backing, 4-Door Sedans have a higher chance of crashing from failure to yield right-of-way than Suburbans.

* Finding 3: In recent time, the Japanese vehicle manufacturer Toyota is infamous for accelerator problems in their cars.
However, close competitor Honda also has accelerator problems in their cars, with failure rates similar to Toyotas in certain years of manufacture.Hondas also have a higher rate of power steering failure than Toyotas.

* Each finding is validated using Seaborn data visualization library of Python.
